## Identified Vulnerabilities

### Critical: pyo3 0.20.3

**Advisory ID:** RUSTSEC-2025-0020  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Issue:** Risk of buffer overflow in `PyString::from_object`  
**Current Version:** 0.20.3  
**Required Version:** >=0.24.1  
**URL:** https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0020

**Description:**
`PyString::from_object` took `&str` arguments and forwarded them directly to the Python C API without checking for terminating nul bytes. This could lead the Python interpreter to read beyond the end of the `&str` data and potentially leak contents of the out-of-bounds read (by raising a Python exception containing a copy of the data including the overflow).

**Impact:**
- Affects all packages using pyo3 0.20.x
- Fixed in pyo3 0.24.1+
- Requires code changes to upgrade (breaking changes between 0.20 and 0.24)

**Dependency Tree:**
```
pyo3 0.20.3
├── rapfiles 0.0.1
└── pyo3-asyncio 0.20.0
    └── rapfiles 0.0.1
```

**Recommended Action:**
Upgrade pyo3 and pyo3-asyncio to >=0.24.1 as part of Phase 1 roadmap improvements.

## Security Practices

### Code Security
- ✅ No unsafe code blocks in codebase
- ✅ All code passes clippy security-focused lints
- ✅ Uses safe Rust APIs exclusively

### Dependency Management
- 🔄 Regular security audits recommended via `cargo audit`
- 🔄 Monitor for dependency updates
- 🔄 Update dependencies as part of regular maintenance

## Running Security Checks

### Cargo Audit
```bash
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo audit
```

### Clippy Security Lints
```bash
cargo clippy --lib --all-features -- -W clippy::suspicious -W clippy::correctness
```

### Check for Unsafe Code
```bash
grep -r "unsafe {" src/ --include="*.rs"
```

## Update Schedule

Security audits should be run:
- Before each release
- Weekly via automated CI/CD (see `.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- After any dependency updates
